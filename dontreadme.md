# Extra Crap

This contains some utility mods I used while setting up and testing, but that nobody needs to load.  It also contains a list of rejected mods and why.  Moved this all to a separate file to unclutter the README.md file.

## Utility (client)

### SkToolbox

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/8

The original and ultimate cheat mod.  Basically adds a bunch of console commands to let you manipulate the world, spawn in crap, fly, become invisible to mobs, etc.  Before discovering Rune Magic, I used this for terrain manipulation.  I also use it during testing to spawn in materials.

### VNEI - Valheim Not Enough Items (client)

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1457

Basically NEI/JEI from the Minecraft world for Valheim.  It lets you see all possible items and recipes.  Lets you dump out item info in various formats to make configuring things like Creature Level and Loot Control eaiser.  I used it to mess about with stack sizes as I wanted to make all food stackable in stacks of 20 (drove me nuts to have some 10 max and some 20 max food items).


## Rejected

These are all mods I tried out and rejected for the reasons I've explained below.

### Basement

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1118

While the concept is cool(ish), the bugs are just too scary as people talk of vanishing basements.  It also never appeared in my contruction tab even when I had the required materials.  It may be that it needs to be updated for H&H.

### Better Archery

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/348

While lauded as the ultimate fix to bows and arrows in the game, I found the changes to bow trajectory to be non-intuitive.  I found myself having to shoot at targets feet if they were far off, their crotches when close and missing a lot when firing down on targets.  Also the arrow retrieval system only works for vanilla arrows, no way to add custom arrows and the quiver doesn't work with extended inventory (and isn't really needed if you use the 3 quick slots for arrows as I do).

### Better Continets

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/446

Alters world generation.  Using the default settings, I got much rougher terrain in places with a lot more steep inclines (which anti slip shoes helps with).  Not really sure making the world more hilly is "better".  It also apparently makes the streams better, but not sure I see that.  The pack is a little laggy at least in local server mode, I'm wondering if pulling this out might help with that.

### Better Networking 1.2.2

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1570

If you've been experiencing lag or desync when playing with your friends, this is the solution!  NOPE!  Made all these things appear in abundance.

### Candles Lanterns and Beeswax

https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RobinHood/Candles_LanternsANDbeeswaxx_02050/

This is a fixed version of the one available on Nexus.

Adds a whole new material beeswax which is a PITA to make in quantity.  Also the candles and such seemed to keep going out.  On top of that the other Building and Decoration mods include a lot of new lights and candles and such.

### Keezy's Better Wolves

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/244

Not really needed any more with the latest patch to silence tamed wolf howls.  The other feature of making tamed wolves take less damage could be provided by CLLC if desired.

### MofoMojo's Drop Item Using Camera Direction

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1101

While the concept was appealing to me, being able to drop items the way your character is looking rather than physically facing, it's broken.  With it installed I couldn't drop anything (so it totally failed in it's one simple task).

### Slope Combat Fix

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/727

Uncaps the Y angle of your attacks so you can now look straight down or up and hit things if they are in range. This should've been in the game right off the bat.  (DLL is named HitboxFix.dll).

Seemed to screw too much with firing arrows down onto things.  I shot hundreds of arrows into the ground missing targets below me.

### ValheimRaft

https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1136

Crazy mod that adds a raft you can build on.  So you can effectively have a mobile base (though there are some glitches with beds and portals on a raft).  Seemed to cause huge lag when I made one of these, so ripped it out.
